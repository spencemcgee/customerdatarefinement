Customer Data Processor
This Python script processes customer data provided in a .txt file, removes bad data, and combines entries based on identical addresses. It then generates a DataFrame for further analysis or storage.


Key Features:

Data Cleaning: Removes rows with missing values to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

Data Combination: Combines entries with the same address into a single row, reducing redundancy and improving data organization.

Input Flexibility: Accepts customer data in the form of a .txt file, allowing for easy data source selection.

DataFrame Output: Outputs the processed data into a pandas DataFrame, facilitating data manipulation and analysis.


Functions:

read_text_to_dataframe(txt_filename):
Reads data from a text file and converts it into a DataFrame.

clean_out_bad_data(df):
Cleans out rows with missing values from the DataFrame.

combine_columns(group):
Combines the values of each column into a single string for each group.

combine_household(df):
Combines rows with the same address into a single row.


Usage:

Prepare Customer Data: Ensure customer data is formatted correctly in a .txt file.

Run the Script: Execute the Python script and provide the path to the input .txt file.

Data Processing:
The script will read the data, clean out bad data, and combine entries based on identical addresses.

Output Data: The processed data will be printed as DataFrames, providing insights into the original, cleaned, and combined data.

Example Usage:
bash
Copy code
python customer_data_processor.py input_data.txt


Note:
Ensure the .txt file follows the correct format: each line representing a customer entry with '|' separated fields (Name, Address, City).
Review the generated DataFrames to ensure data processing was successful and meets your requirements.
